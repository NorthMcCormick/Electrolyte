# Electrolyte

The bridge between Cordova phonegap and Electron

### Goals

Electrolyte's focus is to bridge the gap between Cordova and Electron. Plugin shims allow developers to continue to share a single codebase for not only mobile platforms, but now desktop platforms too. Each shim is modeled as close as possible to its cordova plugin interface. 

### Roadmap
